# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Researcher: Dr. Carl Arrington, Jr.

# Overview
The researcher used knowledge of machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup using the features in the charity_data.csv file.

The CSV contained more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The dataset contained a number of columns that captured metadata about each organization.

# Data Preprocessing
1. What variable(s) are considered the target for your model? - The "Is_Successful" column denotes whether the organization was successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? - NAME, APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT
3. What variable(s) are neither and should be removed from the input data? EIN - (Employer Identification) and in the first two deliverables NAME was dropped as well as to not confuse the ML models into confusing significance
# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
4. How many neurons, layers, and and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
5. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
6. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
